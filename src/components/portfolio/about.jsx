        Hello, I am Tanadon Santisan, but you can call me Poon. I am a
        12th-grade student from Panyaprateep School. I was born and raised in
        Thailand. I have been fascinated with computers and technology since
        childhood, and I love to innovate new things.
        <br />
        <br />
        Iâ€™m easily inspired and more than willing to follow my fascinations
        wherever they take me. I have very high energy and boundless enthusiasm
        for learning and developing myself.
      </p>
