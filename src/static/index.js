        "After I discovered my love of programming, I worked on many projects with seniors at the university and participated in many competitions. The first project I worked on was for a competition from Microsoft and Tech Bite Competition. For it, we created a startup intended to make record income and expenses easier through an application. The main point of the application is to make transaction recording easy by implementing image processing and voice recognition, keep track and analyze your spending and achieve your goals.",
        "The goal of the Zigma application is to be the solution for personal and organizational money management. We see problems with money management apps that spending too much time tracking expenses daily. Some applications need to pay a high cost for effective functions, and some take too many processes. The user interface is too hard to comprehend, and the lack of motivation for the user.",
        "Therefore, we were trying to solve those pain points by design applications that are easy to use, easy to understand, and fast. We implement text and voice recognition to make daily recording transactions quick and easy—Tesseract OCR with Python and speech to text with Microsoft Azure. In addition, to be an application for managing money, we came up with a feature to set a personal goal. And we bring the algorithm from my past project, Rood Application, to help our users reach the goal.",
        "The project is still in the development process, and we hope it will release within next year. Been through this project taught me many, many things. Empathizing our user is one of the keys to making it easy to use and comprehend. Ai and Machine Learning is a very new thing to me. This project opened up the opportunity for me to develop my programming skills, understanding of machine learning, and collaboration as a team. Innovating innovation and being in a competition is very challenging. Working with experienced people Getting advice from a mentor made me learn a lot of new things!",

In collaboration with the School of Changemakers, my school gave us the opportunity to create our own business. We studied many tools to build up the business, business model canvas, design thinking, and many others. Rood Application is a project inspired by the idea of solving the credit card debt problem among Generation Y teenagers, with 56% having debt because of the lack of management tools and knowledge about credit cards.",
        "Our goal was to create an application that will help you manage your money. Set a goal by yourself to reduce debt or prevent it and give the information about credit cards simultaneously. We initiated our project and discussed our idea with the mentors. In the early stage of empathizing with stakeholders, we explored in detail with many teenagers, surveying via an online form and also interviewing them across central Thailand.",
        "After that, we identified the problem and ideated that idea into the application's prototype. We invented the formula and program that allows users to fill in the amount of debt they have, their costs of a day and fixed cost, desired goal. Results are money that they shouldn't spend more than in one day. We tested the prototype by opening a booth in the innovation exhibition, and the feedback was great. Still, our team decided not to continue due to a lack of knowledge and the time we have in developing the application.",
